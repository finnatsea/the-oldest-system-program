## About
This fragment in Hegel’s handwriting was found in his notebook and published in 1917 by F. Rosenzweig and attributed to Schelling. In 1926, W. Böhm argued
Hölderlin was the author. It was not until 1965 that O. Pöggeler came forward with the thesis that Hegel was the author
of this fragment. Since then, scholars have debated which of the Tübingen Three – Hegel, Hölderlin, or Schelling - is
the true author.
